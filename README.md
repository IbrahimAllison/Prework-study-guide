## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

My motivation is to be able to learn coding and add it to my experience as a manual software tester. This would enable me to get job opportunities as a SDET or as a Full Stack Web Developer.

- Why did you build this project? 

I build this project in order to get a first taste of a day to day routine of a Web Developer. Dive more into the concepts of computational thinking and pseudocode as well as get a glimpse of how a Website is created using some of the modern website creation tools.

- What problem does it solve?

It solves the problem of creating a web application to solving real-world problem. The problem here is reducing the information overload that an average coding bootcamp student experience. Puttong down notes through my bootcamp journey will go along way in solving the problem of information overload.

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Gits, GitHub, JavaScript, Readme, and Deployment.
